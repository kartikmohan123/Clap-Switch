In this project we on/off an LED by the sound of clap. A sound sensor is used to detect the sound and send the signal to the Arduino which sets the LED to on/off. 

The components used are : 
•	ARDUINO UNO
•	SOUND SENSOR
•	BREADBOARD
•	LED
•	JUMPER WIRES
•	RESISTOR

When the sensor senses a sound, a digital high signal is send to the Arduino which turns the LED ‘ON’. The LED remains in ‘ON’ state until another sound is detected by the sound sensor. When the sound is detected again a high signal is sent to the Arduino. It checks the state of the LED and turns it ‘OFF’,
